## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(DescTools)
```

```{r beach}
beach <- data.frame(beach_data)
sd(beach$Weight)
barplot(beach$Weight)

#setting 1 
barplot(beach$Weight,
        names=beach$Animal,
        col ="pink")

#part 3 
aov(Weight ~ Animal, data = beach) #case sensitive 
beach_aov <-aov(Weight ~ Animal, data = beach)
summary(beach_aov)
```

```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
